 Just wanna be known well
 I'd rather be lonely than be by myself
 Don't wanna go home
 Or put my pride on the shelf
 Cause I don't need help from anyone else
 And I've been feeling so low
 Help me back into character, I was
 ""Reckless kid, born and raised in America""
 Now I'm a lost cause and truth be told
 I lie too much, my bad
 Trust me I'm working on it
 ♪
 I thought I'd die young
 Likes didn't do shit
 I know well being well known's useless
 I'll go to hell too eager to care
 I'm on a screen island where no one stares
 I wanna find whats inside me
 Feel every fiber
 Done sucking up cause I'm no longer a liar
 Don't know how to be myself sometimes
 But whenever I need your help
 I always tell you now
 I know now, it was all costumes
 Funny dances to play my mind
 Now I need to believe it
 And I won't hold onto something familiar
 We were kept back from the people we really were
 It's a start
 I just hope I acknowledge the gifts from the past
 When we run out of time
 I just wanna be known well
 Not well known
 I'd rather be lonely than be alone
 I'd rather sleep in a hotel than sleep in my home
 But I've been pulling my weight in my thoughts
 No matter where I go
 I've been feeling so low
 Help me back into character, I was
 ""Reckless kid, born and raised in America""
 Now I'm a lost cause and truth be told
 I lie too much, my bad
 I've got a star studded cast of friends
 That never answer the phone no matter when I call
 Gotta stop trying so hard to try so hard
 Otherwise I'll have nobody at all
 I'm still learning to be direct
 Cause for years I've been a mess
 In '18 I changed address
 Not the right one, but the best
 Cause my parents are my success
 I still need to earn their respect
 I'm just trying to figure it out
 There's probably a lot that
 I should've done differently
 And I, oh I went to hear it out
 But I was never listening
 I knew that it's not alright
 Just trying to find the light
 Summon another spark
 Or maybe it's gone and died
 I try to stay out of sight
 I gotta leave by the night
 I can't seem to clear my mind
 But I know now, that it was all
 A bad dream, crash scene playing in my mind
 And I shouldn't believe it, so I
 Can't hold onto something familiar
 When I've lost sight of the people we really were at the start
 And I've started to see it, 'cause
