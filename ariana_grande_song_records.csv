 Then just one look is all it takes
 I feel your eyes, they're locked on every part of me

 True love doesn't die
 It holds on tight and never lets you go

 We really fucked it up, fucked it up this time
 It's so close, I can feel the heat big time

 As I'm wishing he's all mine
 He's giving me Elvis
 With some James Dean in his eyes
 Puts his lips on my neck
 Makes me want to give him my body

 Herc was on a roll
 Person of the week in ev'ry Greek opinion poll
 What a pro
 Herc could stop a show
 Point him at a monster
 And you're talkin' S.R.O.
 He was a no one
 A zero, zero
 Now he's a honcho
 He's a hero
 Here was a kid with his act down pat
 From zero to hero
 In no time flat
 Zero to hero
 Just like that
 When he smiled
 The girls went wild
 With oohs and aahs
 And they slapped his face
 On ev'ry vase
 (On ev'ry ""vahse"")
 From appearance fees and royalties
 Out Herc had cash to burn
 Now nouveau riche an' famous
 He could tell you
 What's a Grecian urn
 Say amen
 There he goes again
 Sweet and undefeated
 And an awesome 10 for 10
 Folks lined up
 Just to watch him flex
 And this perfect package
 Packed a pair of pretty pecs
 Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
 Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
 He showed the moxie brains and spunk
 From zero to hero
 A major hunk
 Zero to hero
 And who'da thunk
 Who put the glad in gladiator
 Hercules
 Whose daring deeds are great the-a-ter
 Hercules
 Is he bold
 No one braver
 Is he sweet
 Our fav'rite flavor
 Hercules, Hercules
 Hercules, Hercules
 Hercules, Hercules
 Hercules, Hercules
 Hercules, Hercules
 Bless my soul
 Herc was on a roll
 Undefeated
 Riding high
 And the nicest guy
 Not conceited
 He was a nothin'
 A zero, zero
 Now he's a honcho
 He's a hero
 He hit the heights at breakneck speed
 From zero to hero
 Herc is a hero
 Now he's a hero

 Ah, guess you're way above it now
 And that's your way to love it now
 How can they tell you shit that you've been through?
 They are so confused, who cares about their rationale?
 If it ain't your view
 That's the bottom line
 Know-it-all (know-it-all)
 Give you a box of chances, every time you blow it all (blow it all)
 As if it were shade, you would just throw it all (throw it all)
 It's like you're trying not to glow at all (glow at all)
 Know-it-all (know-it-all)
 The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole, stole, st-st-stole
 The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole
 The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole, stole, stole
 The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole
 The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole, stole, st-st-stole
 The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole
 The light is coming to give back everything the darkness stole, stole, stole

 Why do we have chemistry? (Ay, yeah)
 With a need for speed (ay, yeah)
 Doin' things that trouble clings (ay, yeah) to
 And burns off our wings
 Ah, gonna break that shit down (ay, yeah)
 You don't wait, tell 'em wait another round (ay, yeah)
 Ah, guess you're way above it now (ay, yeah)

 But, baby, I don't need no savior
 I'm way outta line
 But I kind of like the way I
 Feel when I just don't give a fuck
 I forgot to mention
 I'll be there in five
 We don't really need to talk too much
 Show each other what we know
 I got other ways to catch you up
 Couldn't do it on the phone
 So can you keep it secret?
 This ain't no game, won't play with you
 This time I know I'll stay with you
 Just promise you won't say nothin'
 Don't you be actin' like that, don't you be actin' like that, babe
 No phone, no pics, no postin' us
 This love just ain't disposable
 Just take what's yours, don't run from it
 Don't you be actin' like that, don't you be actin' like that, babe
 Said baby it's just in my nature
 To be a little troublemaker
 So wrong, but so right
 Know you really like the way I
 Taste when we kiss, you reminisce
 But this ain't the last time
 Just stay by my side
 We don't really need to talk too much
 Show each other what we know
